# üÉè WIP - 21 Card Game - WIP üÉè

Welcome to more fine cuisine in the Casino Royale series for @becodeorg ! <br>This time it's the well known 21 game,
also known as Black Jack. <b> I never played that much card games, so if your a veteran in this game, there will be better 
<br>version for you ;). The main intent of this project is building the logic and functions from scratch, rather than <br>
creating the next big mobile app. Read what this is all about below. First up, have a peep ;
