# 🃏 WIP - 21 Card Game - WIP 🃏

Welcome to more fine cuisine in the Casino Royale series for @becodeorg ! <br>This time it's the well known 21 game,
also known as Black Jack. <b> I never played that much card games,<br> so if your a veteran in this game, there will be better 
versions out there for you ;). <br>The main intent of this project is building the logic and functions from scratch, rather than
creating the next big mobile app. <br> Read what this is all about below. First up, have a peep ; <br><br>

## Disclaimer
This project is a Work In Progress. For now you are able to test out the most basic functionalities for the Hit button. See below @ the WIP section, to see what you can expect later. 

## How it works
- Refresh page to start new round.
- Click HIT :
    - new hand draws for both players
    - value of player hands update
    - algoryhtm checks total ; 
        - if < 21 : draw new card or stand 
        - if > 21 : BUST innerHTML appears (Game Over)
