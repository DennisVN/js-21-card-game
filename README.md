# üÉè WIP - 21 Card Game - WIP üÉè

Welcome to more fine cuisine in the Casino Royale series for @becodeorg ! <br>This time it's the well known 21 game,
also known as BlackJack. <b> I never played that much card games,<br> so if you're a veteran in this game, there will be better 
versions out there for you ;). <br>The main intent of this project is building the logic and functions from scratch, rather than
creating the next big mobile app. <br> Read what this is all about below. First up, have a peep ; <br><br>
